PROBLEM STATEMENT
                    This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 vaccine data, emphasizing vaccine efficacy, distribution, and adverse effects. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights to assist policymakers and health organizations in optimizing vaccine deployment strategies. The project encompasses data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization.

DESIGN THINKING
1. Data Collection
Objective: Collection of  COVID-19 vaccine data from credible sources to ensure data accuracy.
Approach:
- Utilizing a reliable dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress) as the primary source, which contains worldwide vaccination progress data.
- Gathering supplementary data from authoritative health organizations and government databases.

2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Preparation of data for analysis by cleaning and handling missing values.
Approach:
- Elimination duplicate records and irrelevant columns.
- Employment of appropriate methods to address missing data, including imputation or removal.
- Converting categorical data into numerical representations for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Gaining a deep understanding of the dataset and identify key trends and outliers.
Approach:
- Generating descriptive statistics and visuals to summarize the data (e.g., mean, median, histograms).
- Exploration of temporal trends in vaccine distribution and efficacy.
- Detection and investigation of any outliers or anomalies for further consideration.




4. Statistical Analysis
Objective: Conducting statistical tests to analyse vaccine efficacy, adverse effects, and distribution across populations.
Approach:
- Perform hypothesis tests to assess vaccine efficacy and compare different vaccine types.
- Analysing potential associations between adverse effects and specific vaccines or demographics.
- Investigating the geographical and demographic distribution of vaccines.

5. Visualization
Objective: Creating informative visualizations to present key findings and insights.
Approach:
- Utilizing suitable visualization techniques (e.g., bar plots, line charts, heatmaps) to represent the data effectively.
- Developing visualizations for vaccine distribution, efficacy trends, adverse effects, and demographic analyses.
- Incorporating interactive elements as needed for enhanced engagement.

6. Insights and Recommendations
Objective: Providing concise insights and actionable recommendations to support decision-making.
Approach:
- Summarizing significant findings from the EDA and statistical analysis.
- Offer data-driven recommendations for optimizing vaccine deployment, enhancing efficacy, and addressing adverse effects.
- Presenting insights in a clear and concise manner to facilitate decision-making.

Conclusion
This project aims to conduct a thorough analysis of COVID-19 vaccine data, delivering valuable insights for policymakers and health organizations. The outlined design thinking approach covers data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, visualization, and the delivery of actionable insights and recommendations. The primary data source will be the Kaggle dataset, supplemented by data from reputable health organizations and government databases.
